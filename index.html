            I graduated from the University of Washington Seattle in December
            2020 with a bachelor of science degree in Electrical Engineering.
            While I have spent the past few years developing imaging algorithms
            for ultrasonic transducers and researching on spinal cord injury
            using ultrasound imaging, I have also learned and become interested
            in a lot of different skills such as data analytics, data science,
            and software developing. Coding in different programming languages
            and solving complex problems has always been my passion and
            triggered my curiosity. Therefore, I want to pursue this exciting
            tech industry as my career path, and this portfolio will signify my
            commitment in this specific field.
          </p>
          <p>
            From my previous role at Sonic Concepts Inc. as an Ultrasound
            Imaging Engineer consultant, I learned how to lead a big project and
            make all the decisions regarding designing, prototyping, testing,
            and data collecting to present it to my client. With each decision I
            made, each bug I dealt with, or each approach I used, I continued
            improving my problem-solving skill and the ability to learn quickly
            to deliver the best result to my clients. I also learned how to
            manage my time well when I worked on my capstone project with Amazon
            along with 4 other teammates, as I was a team leader and got to
            distribute the work for each member and keep track of the work that
            each of us did in order to deliver the best results in a timely
            manner in weekly meetings. I believe that being able to use the
            technical skillsets I have learned from my past experience and
            integrate it with my soft skills along the way is a key to my
            success story, and I will continue doing that to reach my career
            goals.

              Guess My Drawing is an interactive drawing game between players
              and an Alexa Echo device. An Amazon AWS deep-learning camera
              called

              will capture what a player draws on a whiteboard or a white paper
              and inference the drawing to the most relevant object. This game
              is a great way for developers who are interested in deep-learning
              applications with DeepLens and exploring AWS services and how to
              connect DeepLens with Alexa skills.

              I led this project with 4 other teammates and reported to a
              Software Engineer and a Product Manager from Amazon. I was in
              charge of designing and implementing the entire Alexa voice
              interface and supporting my team with imaging algorithms for
              pre-processing the input data (the drawings captured by DeepLens)
              to match the input data of the deep-learning model. After 6 months
              of hard work, our team was able to deliver a comprehensive and
              thorough project, and the project was published in the AWS
              Deeplens community (link below).
